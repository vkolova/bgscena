== Installation ==

= Minimum Requirements =

* WordPress 3.5 or greater
* PHP version 5.2.4 or greater
* MySQL version 5.0 or greater

= Automatic installation =

Automatic installation is the easiest option as WordPress handles the file transfers itself and you don’t even need to leave your web browser. To do an automatic install of impleCode eCommerce Product Catalog, log in to your WordPress admin panel, navigate to the Plugins menu and click Add New.

In the search field type “impleCode” and click Search Plugins. Once you’ve found our product catalog plugin you can view details about it such as the the point release, rating and description. Most importantly of course, you can install it by simply clicking Install Now. After clicking that link you will be asked if you’re sure you want to install the plugin. Click yes and WordPress will automatically complete the installation.

= Manual installation =

The manual installation method involves downloading our product catalog plugin and uploading it to your web-server via your favourite FTP application.

1. Download the plugin file to your computer and unzip it
2. Using an FTP program, or your hosting control panel, upload the unzipped plugin folder to your WordPress installation’s wp-content/plugins/ directory.
3. Activate the plugin from the Plugins menu within the WordPress admin.

= Upgrading =

Automatic updates should work like a charm; as always though, ensure you backup your site just in case.

If on the off-chance you do encounter issues with the product catalog pages after an update you simply need to flush the permalinks by going to WordPress > Settings > Permalinks and hitting 'save'. That should return things to normal.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Is it possible to use eCommerce product catalog without ecommerce functionality? =

Yes, just leave the product price empty and you will disable ecommerce functionality.

= Are there any payment gateways? =

There are payment gateways available on the [extensions page](https://implecode.com/wordpress/plugins/?cam=wordpress-org-catalog-faq&key=extensions-page#conversion_boosters "eCommerce Product Catalog Theme Integration Guide on impleCode.com").

= Will eCommerce Product Catalog work with my theme? =

Yes. eCommerce Product Catalog will work with any theme but in some cases may require some styling to make it match nicely. Please see [Theme Integration Guide](https://implecode.com/wordpress/product-catalog/theme-integration-guide/#cam=wordpress-org-catalog-faq&key=catalog-integration "eCommerce Product Catalog Theme Integration Guide on impleCode.com") for help.

= Why product image is not working? =

If you cannot add product image it means that your theme is not supporting featured image feature. Please see [WordPress Codex](http://codex.wordpress.org/Post_Thumbnails "Featured image support").

= How to change category prefix "All"? =

To change category prefix or any other front-end text go to product settings > Front-end labels and change to empty or any value.

= Where can I request new features, themes and extensions? =

We are available on the support forum and through impleCode website.

= Where can I report bugs and contribute to the project? =

Bugs can be reported on the support forum.

= Where can I find impleCode documentation and user guides? =

Documentation is available [here](https://implecode.com/wordpress/product-catalog/#cam=wordpress-org-catalog-faq&key=catalog-docs "eCommerce Product Catalog Documentation on impleCode.com").

= Is this an ecommerce plugin? =

Yes, but it is not a store. See the question below.

= What's the difference between eCommerce Product Catalog and classic ecommerce plugin (e.g. store)? =

This is not a store. It's main purpose is to present products or services on the website in a convenient and easy to manage way. It's more lightweight than most of eCommerce Plugins. It's commonly used for company pages or blogs with product catalogue. It's easily CSS customisable and has 3 themes for product listings in the default version. It can be extended to work with product quotes (for products without price), order forms (for product with price), payment gateways, PDF specifications and even separate catalogues with separate menus in admin.
